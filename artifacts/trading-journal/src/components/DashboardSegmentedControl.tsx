/**
 * Full-width iOS-style segmented control shown above the Account Value card
 * (and mirrored on the Reports page). Selected state is derived from the
 * current route (not local state) so it always reflects reality — navigating
 * back from Reports automatically re-selects Dashboard without any extra
 * bookkeeping.
 *
 * The pill is a plain CSS `transform: translate3d` transition, deliberately
 * NOT driven by Motion.dev/React state interpolation. Reports→Dashboard is
 * the moment the kept-alive Dashboard subtree flips from `display:none` back
 * to visible and resumes its own live-tick/chart RAF work — a big, unavoidable
 * chunk of main-thread work lands on the exact same frame the pill starts
 * moving. A JS-driven animation (even one that *can* offload to the
 * compositor) still depends on the main thread being free to schedule that
 * first tick; a native CSS transition on `transform` is handed to the
 * compositor thread as soon as the style is committed and then runs
 * completely independently of main-thread congestion, so it can't drop
 * frames no matter how busy the rest of the page is at that moment.
